ai_response: Subject: Request for Additional Information – WhatsApp Project Requirements

Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As we begin the requirement analysis phase for the new WhatsApp project, I would like to ensure that we have a comprehensive understanding of the objectives, scope, and expectations. To conduct a thorough and accurate analysis, I kindly request additional information on the following:

The primary goals and success criteria for the project
Key user groups and their expected interactions with the system
Any existing documentation or reference materials
Integration points with external systems or platforms
Timelines, constraints, or dependencies we should be aware of
Having this information will enable us to align our analysis with your vision and ensure that we capture all critical requirements from the outset.

Please let me know a convenient time if you’d prefer to discuss this in a quick call. I appreciate your support and look forward to your input.

Warm regards,
Nombulelo July
Business Analyst
